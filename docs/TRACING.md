# OpenTelemetry Tracing

> Distributed tracing for OphirPay: follow one payment across the HTTP
> handler, the Soroban contract call, the Horizon interaction and the
> database writes — in a single trace, correlated with the request id your
> logs already carry.

## Why

The existing telemetry answers *how many* and *how slow* (Prometheus counters
and latency histograms on `/api/metrics`) and *what happened* (structured
logs with redaction and request ids). Neither reconstructs *where the time
went* for one particular request. Tracing does: a single payment becomes one
trace whose spans cover the API handler, the Soroban simulation and
submission, the Horizon polls, and the Prisma writes — with per-span timing.

## Opt-in only

Tracing is **disabled by default**. Unless `OTEL_TRACING_ENABLED=true`:

- the OpenTelemetry SDK is never imported (`startTracing` returns before any
  dynamic `import()`), so cold start, memory and request latency are
  untouched;
- span helpers (`getTracer`, `getCurrentSpan`) return no-ops, so
  instrumentation call sites cost one boolean check;
- no exporter is constructed and no network egress happens.

Turning it on is a runtime decision, not a rebuild: set the env vars and
restart the server.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `OTEL_TRACING_ENABLED` | *(off)* | `true` starts the Node SDK at boot |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:4318` | OTLP/HTTP collector endpoint |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` | `http/json` | `http/json` or `http/proto` |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `ophirpay` | Resource name attached to every span |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` | `parentbased_always_on` | Sampler; `parentbased_traceidratio` for probabilistic |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` | `0.1` | Ratio when using `traceidratio` |

Minimal local setup with a collector:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 4318:4318 otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest
OTEL_TRACING_ENABLED=true npm run dev
```

The export protocol/endpoint variables follow the standard OpenTelemetry
environment conventions, so any collector (Grafana Tempo, Jaeger, Datadog
Agent, Honeycomb, AWS X-Ray collector) works without code changes.

## Sampling policy

- **Development**: `parentbased_always_on` (the default) — every trace
  recorded, cheapest possible feedback loop.
- **Production**: `parentbased_traceidratio` with `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG`
  between `0.05` and `0.25` depending on traffic. The `parentbased` prefix
  keeps the decision consistent across services that share a trace.
- Payment submission flows are short-lived and low-volume relative to read
  traffic; if you need full fidelity on the *write* path, sample at the
  collector instead (tail sampling on `ophirpay.payment_id` presence) rather
  than raising the head-sampling ratio.

## Request-id correlation

The proxy mints (or accepts) an `X-Request-Id`, returns it in the response
header, and the request-logging boundary stamps it onto every structured log
line. With tracing enabled the same id is written to the active span under:

```
ophirpay.request_id = <X-Request-Id>
```

The key is part of the attribute allowlist below, so it survives export.
Join logs to traces with `trace attributes["ophirpay.request_id"]` and traces
to logs with the standard `trace_id` field — the two systems correlate
instead of competing.

## Attribute policy (no PII)

Spans are exported off-host, so they get a stricter policy than logs. Only
attributes on this allowlist may be set or exported; everything else passed
to `safeSpanAttributes()` (or `span.setAttribute` through the tracer wrapper)
is dropped:

| Key | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `http.request.method` | `POST` | |
| `http.route` | `/api/payments/[id]` | Route template, not the raw URL |
| `http.response.status_code` | `201` | |
| `server.address` | `api.example.com` | |
| `url.path` | `/api/payments/p_1` | Path only |
| `url.query` | `?window=30d` | Never contains tokens |
| `db.system` | `postgresql` | |
| `db.operation` | `payments.create` | |
| `db.statement` | parameterized SQL | Never carries bound values |
| `stellar.network` | `TESTNET` | |
| `stellar.contract_id` | `C…` | Contract ID, not a wallet address |
| `stellar.operation` | `record_payment` | |
| `ophirpay.request_id` | UUID | The correlation key |
| `ophirpay.payment_id` | `p_…` | Application id |
| `ophirpay.batch_id` | `b_…` | Application id |
| `ophirpay.webhook_id` | `w_…` | Application id |
| `ophirpay.attempt` | `2` | Delivery attempt number |
| `error.type` | `TimeoutError` | Exception class name |

Never attach to a span: wallet addresses or secret keys, memos, emails,
bearer tokens or API keys, raw request/response bodies, free-form user
input. The redaction rules in `src/lib/logger.ts` and the allowlist here are
two sides of the same policy — what cannot be logged cannot be traced.

## What a payment trace looks like

```
POST /api/payments  (server span, ophirpay.request_id=3f1c…)
├── middleware: rate limit / auth
├── prisma: payment.create
├── stellar: simulate  (soroban contract call)
├── stellar: submit    (sendTransaction)
└── stellar: poll horizon until confirmed
```

HTTP auto-instrumentation creates the server span; Prisma and outbound fetch
(spans 2–5) come from the Node auto-instrumentations; the manual
`stellar.*` spans wrap the contract helpers via `getTracer("stellar")`.

## Implementation map

- Gate + SDK bootstrap: `src/lib/tracing.ts` (`isTracingEnabled`,
  `startTracing`)
- Startup hook: `src/instrumentation.ts` (non-fatal on failure)
- Request-id stamping: `src/lib/request-logging.ts` (calls
  `getCurrentSpan()`)
- Attribute policy: `ALLOWED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_KEYS` in `src/lib/tracing.ts`
- Tests: `src/__tests__/tracing.test.ts`
